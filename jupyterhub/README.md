# JupyterHub

JupyterHub comes with 2 components:

1. [jupyterhub](#jupyterhub)
1. [notebook-images](#notebook-images)

## JupyterHub

Contains deployment manifests for JupyterHub instance.

### Parameters

JupyterHub component comes with 2 parameters exposed vie KFDef.

#### s3_endpoint_url

HTTP endpoint exposed by your S3 object storage solution which will be made available to JH users in `S3_ENDPOINT_URL` env variable.

#### storage_class

Name of the storage class to be used for PVCs created by JupyterHub component. This requires `storage-class` **overlay** to be enabled as well to work.

#### jupyterhub_groups_config

A ConfigMap containing comma separated lists of groups which would be used as Admin and User groups for JupyterHub. The default ConfgiMap can be found [here](jupyterhub/base/jupyterhub-groups-configmap.yaml).

#### jupyterhub_secret

A Secret containing configuration values like JupyterHub DB password or COOKIE_SECRET. The default Secret can be found [here](jupyterhub/base/jupyterhub-secret.yaml).

##### Examples

```
  - kustomizeConfig:
      overlays:
      - storage-class
      parameters:
        - name: storage_class
          value: standard
        - name: s3_endpoint_url
